This a CRUD intended to be used for listing Star Wars Planets.

## Tecnical review
##### Versions

It was created using Java 1.8 and JSF + Primefaces.

The versions for each dependency can be seem at pom.xml archive. But it was used Tomcat 8.5 and local mysql to run the server and database.


## Getting Started
First, copy this repository, open it on your favorite IDE and install dependencies.

If needed: 

	-> Configure your local server to your IDE and link this repository to it;
	-> Go to the 'persistence.xml' archive and change user and password to your local database (it uses "root" and empty password as default);

Then, run the local server and open [http://localhost:8080/star-wars-planets/](http://localhost:8080/star-wars-planets/) with your browser to use it.
